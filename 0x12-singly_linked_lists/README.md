### 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
